# Interpreting Scan Results

<Callout type="info">
Accessibility scans generate detailed reports outlining your site's compliance level. This page helps you decode and prioritize what the data means.
</Callout>

## Understanding Scan Scores

Your scan results include a set of scores based on Lighthouse and WelcomingWeb's auditing logic.

<Steps>
### Accessibility Score
Reflects overall accessibility compliance (out of 100). A score above 85% is considered excellent.

### SEO Score
Measures your site's search engine friendliness, including structure and metadata accessibility.

### Best Practices Score
Checks code quality, image optimization, HTTPS usage, and browser safety.

### Performance Score
Evaluates page speed, responsiveness, and rendering behavior.

</Steps>

## Issue Categories

Each detected issue falls into one of the following categories:

- **Critical**: Blocks user access or severely impairs experience (e.g., missing alt text, broken ARIA labels)
- **Major**: Impacts usability but doesn’t completely block access
- **Minor**: Low impact; often aesthetic or redundancy-related

Each issue will include:
- Affected element (e.g., `<img>`, `<button>`)
- Explanation of the violation
- WCAG reference (e.g., 1.1.1, 2.4.4)
- Suggestion or fix

## Remediation Tips

- Start with Critical issues for compliance and usability.
- Use the “Fix Suggestions” included in each item.
- Use your developer’s help for HTML, ARIA, or JavaScript-based issues.
- Re-scan after applying fixes to verify improvements.

## When to Re-scan
