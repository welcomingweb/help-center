# Dashboard Overview

<Callout type="info">
Your dashboard provides a real-time snapshot of your accessibility ecosystem: connected sites, scan activity, compliance scores, and progress tracking.
</Callout>

## Key Dashboard Metrics

When you log in to WelcomingWeb, the first thing you’ll see is the dashboard summary. Here’s what’s included:

<Steps>
### Total Sites
Displays the number of websites you’ve connected to your account. Clicking this box will redirect you to the **My Sites** page.

### Average Score
Shows the average accessibility score across all your scanned sites. The score is based on recent scan data and represents your current compliance level.

### Monthly Scans
Tracks how many scans have been completed across all your sites during the current month.

### Critical Issues
Highlights the total number of unresolved high-impact accessibility issues detected in your recent scans.

### Premium Accounts / Free Accounts
Displays the number of sites under premium versus free service levels within your account.
</Steps>

## Onboarding Progress

A dynamic checklist appears at the top of your dashboard to help you complete initial setup steps:
- Adding your first site
- Running your first scan
- Installing the widget
- Reviewing your scan report

Once all steps are completed, the checklist disappears.

## Accessibility Score Trend

A real-time line graph visualizes score progression across scans. It helps you see whether your compliance is improving or declining over time.

## Recent Scans

The dashboard lists your latest scans, including:
- **Domain**
- **Date & Time**
- **Issue Count**
- **Score**
- Direct links to **View Report** and **Summary**

## Tips

- Hover on KPIs to view tooltips.
- If no data is shown, ensure you’ve completed at least one site scan.
