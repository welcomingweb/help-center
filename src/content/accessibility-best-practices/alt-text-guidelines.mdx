# Alt Text Guidelines

Providing good alt text ensures that users who cannot see images still understand their purpose and content.

<Callout type="important">
Always include alt text for any image that conveys information or has a functional role.
</Callout>

## Key Principles

<Steps>
### 1. Be Concise  
Limit to 125 characters or fewer. Screen readers typically stop after this length.

### 2. Be Specific  
Describe what’s relevant. E.g., “Red maple leaf in autumn” rather than “Leaf.”

### 3. Convey Purpose  
If an image is decorative only, use an empty alt attribute (`alt=""`) so it’s skipped by assistive tech.

### 4. Avoid Redundancy  
Don’t repeat information already in nearby text or captions.

### 5. Include Text  
If text appears in the image that’s essential (e.g., button label), include it verbatim.
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Decorative images (e.g., background flourishes) should use `alt=""` or be CSS backgrounds to avoid cluttering assistive tool output.
</Callout>

## Examples

<Table>
  <thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>Use Case</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Bad Alt</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Good Alt</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Informative photo</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>“Image1.jpg”</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>“Smiling teacher reading to children in classroom”</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Button icon</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>“icon.png”</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>“Search”</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Decorative only</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>“Flower pattern”</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>“”</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

<Callout type="warning">
Do not start alt text with “Image of…”—screen readers already announce it as an image.
</Callout>

## Quick Checklist

- ✅ Is it under 125 characters?  
- ✅ Does it describe what matters?  
- ✅ Is decorative content marked `alt=""`?  
- ✅ Did you avoid phrases like “image of” or “graphic of”?
