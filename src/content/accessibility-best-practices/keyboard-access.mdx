# Keyboard Accessibility

All interactive elements must be reachable and usable with the keyboard. This ensures users who cannot operate a mouse—due to mobility impairments, screen readers, or other assistive technologies—can still navigate your site.

<Callout type="important">
Keyboard operability is a core requirement of WCAG and most accessibility regulations.
</Callout>

## Key Principles

<Steps>
### 1. Focus Order

Ensure the tab order follows a logical sequence (usually left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Users should be able to predict which element receives focus next.

### 2. Focus Visibility

Visible focus indicators (outlines, borders, background highlights) must be present on all focusable elements.

### 3. Keyboard Traps

Avoid “trapping” focus in any component (e.g., custom widgets or modal dialogs). Provide a clear way to exit.

### 4. All Actions via Keyboard

Every mouse action (click, drag, hover) must have an equivalent keyboard action (Enter, Space, arrow keys, etc.).

### 5. Skip Links

Include a “Skip to main content” link as the first focusable item, allowing users to bypass repetitive navigation.

<Callout type="info">
Test your site by tabbing through each page. If you lose focus or see no indicator, correct it immediately!
</Callout>

## Common Keyboard Patterns

- **Links and Buttons**  
  - Press **Tab** to focus  
  - Press **Enter** or **Space** to activate  

- **Form Controls**  
  - **Tab** to move between controls  
  - **Arrow keys** to select radio buttons, dropdowns, and sliders  

- **Modal Dialogs**  
  - Focus should move into the dialog when opened  
  - **Esc** should close the dialog and return focus to the trigger  

- **Custom Widgets**  
  - Assign appropriate `role`, `tabindex`, and ARIA attributes  
  - Implement keyboard handlers for all interactions  

<Callout type="warning">
Never remove the default focus outline without providing an equally visible replacement!
</Callout>

## Quick Checklist

- Can you navigate every part of the page with Tab/Shift+Tab?  
- Can you activate every control with Enter or Space?  
- Do modal dialogs trap focus and restore it on close?  
- Are all custom components labeled and keyboard-friendly?  

<Callout type="important">
Keyboard accessibility benefits everyone—power users, screen reader users, and those on small devices alike.
