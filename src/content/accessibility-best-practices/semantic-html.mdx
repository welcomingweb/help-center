# Semantic HTML

Proper use of HTML elements provides meaningful structure, improves screen reader navigation, and boosts SEO.

<Callout type="important">
Semantic markup is the foundation of accessible web content.
</Callout>

## Core Guidelines

<Steps>
### 1. Heading Hierarchy  
Use `<h1>` through `<h6>` in logical order—never skip levels. One `<h1>` per page, then descend sequentially.

### 2. Landmark Elements  
Wrap major page regions in `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` so assistive tech can jump directly to key areas.

### 3. Sectioning Tags  
Group related content with `<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>` + `<figcaption>`, and `<blockquote>` to convey meaning.

### 4. Lists & Tables  
Use `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` for lists and `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<td>` for tabular data—never simulate lists or tables with `<div>`.

### 5. Controls & Labels  
Use `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation, and associate `<label>` with form controls. Avoid using `<span>` or `<div>` as interactive elements.

</Steps>

Screen readers announce semantic elements and allow users to navigate by landmarks, headings, and lists.

## Quick Checklist

- 📝 **Headings:** Are levels sequential and descriptive?  
- 🚩 **Landmarks:** Does each region use proper tags (`<main>`, `<nav>`, etc.)?  
- 📦 **Sections:** Are related blocks wrapped in `<section>` or `<article>`?  
- 📋 **Lists:** Are lists marked up with `<ul>/<ol>` and `<li>`?  
- 🔢 **Tables:** Is tabular data in a real `<table>` with headers?  
- 🔘 **Buttons & Links:** Are interactive elements real HTML controls with labels?

<Callout type="warning">
Avoid using generic containers (`<div>`, `<span>`) for structure—use them only when no semantic element applies.
