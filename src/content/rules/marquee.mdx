# Marquee

<Callout type="info">
elements are deprecated and must not be used
</Callout>

The &lt;marquee&gt; element is deprecated and must not be used in modern HTML. This blog explains what the marquee rule checks, why &lt;marquee&gt; creates accessibility and usability problems, how to remove or replace it and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, accurate and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The marquee rule checks whether a page contains the deprecated &lt;marquee&gt; element. This element was once used to create scrolling or moving text. It is no longer part of the HTML standard and is not supported by modern accessibility requirements.

Use of &lt;marquee&gt; creates non-standard behaviour that screen readers, browsers and assistive technologies cannot reliably interpret.

## Why it matters

The &lt;marquee&gt; element harms accessibility and user experience: - moving text can cause distraction or discomfort, - some users experience difficulty reading text that moves unexpectedly, - users with cognitive impairments may lose context when text scrolls automatically, - screen readers may announce content unpredictably, - users cannot pause, stop or control automatic motion.

Moving or flashing content can also affect people with vestibular or attention-related conditions.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers remove deprecated patterns and replace them with accessible alternatives. Designers avoid motion-heavy text components that cause distraction. Content authors identify content that should be static or restructured. Accessibility specialists and QA testers verify that no &lt;marquee&gt; elements appear in templates. Welcoming Web assists by detecting deprecated marquee usage.

How to ensure  elements are not used

1. Remove any &lt;marquee&gt; elements

Do not rely on scrolling text for important content.

```html
<!-- Remove this --><marquee>Latest updates</marquee>
```

2. Replace with accessible alternatives

Use static text or accessible announcement patterns.

3. Use CSS animations only when necessary

Ensure any scripted motion is user-controlled, predictable and minimal.

4. Provide controls for animated content

If motion is required, offer pause and stop controls.

5. Avoid auto-scrolling content in banners or alerts

Use ARIA live regions only for essential announcements.

## Best practice guidance

Maintain calm, stable interfaces. Use motion only when it adds value and ensure users can control it. Avoid patterns that mimic marquee-like behaviour, such as infinitely scrolling text or automatic sliders without controls. Follow a motion-reduction strategy aligned with user preferences.

## Compliance mapping

Removing &lt;marquee&gt; supports: - WCAG 2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide requirements for moving content, - WCAG 2.2 Info and Relationships expectations, - ADA Title III requirements for perceivable, predictable content, - EN 301 549 guidance on avoiding unnecessary motion, - Equality Act 2010 duties for inclusive interaction.
