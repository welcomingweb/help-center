# Input Image Alt

<Callout type="info">
Image buttons must have alternative text
</Callout>

Image buttons must include meaningful alternative text so users understand the action performed when the button is activated. This blog explains what the input-image-alt rule checks, why alternative text is essential for &lt;input type="image"&gt; elements, how to provide descriptive naming and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider accessibility expectations. The article is fully original, SEO‑optimised and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The input-image-alt rule checks whether &lt;input type="image"&gt; elements provide appropriate alternative text using the alt attribute. Because image buttons do not contain text, their accessible name must come from the alt value.

Assistive technologies read this value aloud to users, allowing them to understand the button’s purpose. Without this name, the button becomes silent or confusing.

## Why it matters

Image buttons are often used for actions such as search, submit, save or navigation. When these controls lack alternative text: - screen reader users cannot determine the button’s function, - form submission becomes guesswork, - important actions may be skipped or misunderstood, - users can trigger unintended behaviour, - overall form navigation becomes unpredictable.

Clear alternative text helps users understand and activate image buttons confidently.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers add descriptive alt attributes to image buttons. Designers define consistent naming patterns across interactive controls. Content authors ensure button labels reflect the intended action. Accessibility specialists and QA testers verify that image buttons expose meaningful, non-empty accessible names. Welcoming Web assists by detecting image buttons without appropriate alternative text.

How to ensure image buttons have alternative text

1. Provide descriptive alt text

Describe the action the button performs.

### Correct example:

```html
<input type="image" src="search.png" alt="Search">
```

2. Avoid generic or unclear labels

Values such as “button” or “image” do not describe the action.

3. Align naming with surrounding controls

Use consistent patterns such as “Submit form”, “Search”, “Save”, or “Continue”.

4. Ensure dynamic image buttons include alt

Templates or scripts that generate image buttons must include descriptive alternative text.

5. Do not rely on ARIA alone

ARIA does not replace the required alt attribute for &lt;input type="image"&gt;.

## Best practice guidance

Use short, action-focused descriptions. Ensure that the image’s visual design does not determine the label; focus on what the user does when activating the button. Keep naming consistent across your design system. For multilingual sites, maintain clear translations that preserve intent.

## Compliance mapping

Providing alternative text for image buttons supports: - WCAG 2.2 Non-Text Content requirements, - WCAG 2.2 Name, Role, Value expectations for interactive controls, - ADA Title III expectations for operable forms, - EN 301 549 guidance on programmatically determinable labels, - Equality Act 2010 duties for accessible user interactions.
