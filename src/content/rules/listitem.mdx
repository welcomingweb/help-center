# Listitem

<Callout type="info">

elements must be contained in a

or

elements must appear inside a valid list container so assistive technologies can understand and present them correctly. This blog explains what the listitem rule checks, why correct list item placement matters, how to use

elements semantically and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, accurate and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The listitem rule checks whether every &lt;li&gt; element is placed inside a &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; element. List items must not appear directly inside &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;section&gt; or other non-list elements.

Using &lt;li&gt; outside a list structure breaks HTML semantics and prevents assistive technologies from interpreting grouped or ordered information accurately.

## Why it matters

When &lt;li&gt; elements are not used semantically: - screen readers cannot identify list items correctly, - the reading order becomes confusing or misleading, - users may not realise that items belong to a related group, - structured content appears fragmented or inconsistent, - assistive technologies cannot announce list lengths or item positions.

Correct list item placement ensures predictable navigation and supports clear information hierarchy.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers structure lists using correct HTML. Content authors ensure CMS-generated content uses valid list elements. Designers define patterns that rely on proper list semantics instead of using list styles for layout. Accessibility specialists and QA testers verify correct list structure across templates. Welcoming Web assists by detecting &lt;li&gt; elements used outside valid list containers.

## How to ensure

elements are used semantically ### 1. Wrap all

elements in a

or

Never place list items directly inside non-list containers.

### Correct example:

```html
<ul>  <li>Item one</li>  <li>Item two</li></ul>
```

### 2. Avoid using

for visual styling Do not use &lt;li&gt; elements to achieve bullet or indentation effects outside proper lists.

### 3. Place nested lists inside an

Correct nested structure ensures assistive technologies maintain proper hierarchy.

```html
<li>  Parent item  <ul>    <li>Child item</li>  </ul></li>
```

4. Correct CMS formatting errors

Rich text editors may output stray &lt;li&gt; tags when formatting is inconsistent.

5. Remove empty or placeholder list items

Avoid using empty &lt;li&gt; elements unless they serve a clear programmatic purpose.

## Best practice guidance

Use lists to group related content, such as navigation menus, checklists or grouped information. Keep list markup consistent across designs and templates. Document list patterns in your design system to avoid misuse of &lt;li&gt; for styling or layout.

## Compliance mapping

Correct list item placement supports: - WCAG 2.2 Info and Relationships success criteria, - WCAG 2.2 Meaningful Sequence requirements, - ADA Title III expectations for logical content structure, - EN 301 549 guidance on programmatically determinable lists, - Equality Act 2010 duties for accessible information hierarchy.

. Do not use

## FAQs

What does the listitem rule check

It checks whether &lt;li&gt; elements are placed inside &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; containers.

### Why must

be inside a list

elements need a valid parent so assistive technologies can announce lists correctly.

### Can

be used outside lists for styling No. &lt;li&gt; should only be used to represent real list items.

How do I add nested lists

Place the nested list inside an &lt;li&gt; of the parent list.

Do CMS editors cause list issues

Yes. Inconsistent formatting may produce stray &lt;li&gt; tags.

What if a list item needs additional markup

Extra content should be placed inside the &lt;li&gt;, not outside.

### Does fixing

placement guarantee WCAG compliance It supports reading order and structure requirements but does not guarantee full compliance.

How does Welcoming Web help with list item issues
