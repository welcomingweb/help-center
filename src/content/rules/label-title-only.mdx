# Label Title Only

<Callout type="info">
Form elements should have a visible label
</Callout>

Form elements must have visible labels so users can understand what information is required. This blog explains what the label-title-only rule checks, why visible labels are essential for accessibility, how to provide reliable labelling for form controls and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, SEO-optimised and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The label-title-only rule checks whether form elements rely solely on hidden labels, the title attribute or aria-describedby for identification. These approaches do not replace a visible label. A visible label provides clear, persistent text that tells users what the field represents, while hidden labels or metadata only support assistive technologies.

Common issues include: - forms labelled only with the title attribute, - fields identified through aria-describedby but with no visible text, - inputs that use placeholder text instead of labels, - UI components where labels are removed for visual design purposes.

## Why it matters

Visible labels provide essential context for all users. When labels are hidden or missing: - users cannot see what each field requires, - screen reader users receive inconsistent or unclear information, - placeholders disappear when typing, removing context entirely, - cognitive load increases because users must guess meaning or recall it, - error messages become unclear because there is no visible label to reference.

Visible labels support predictable, understandable and usable form interactions.

## Who delivers it

Content authors write meaningful labels. Designers ensure visual designs keep labels visible and clear. Front end developers implement semantic &lt;label&gt; elements and avoid removing visible labels for aesthetic reasons. Accessibility specialists and QA testers verify that all fields have visible labels. Welcoming Web assists by detecting inputs that rely only on hidden labels or metadata.

How to ensure form elements have visible labels

1. Provide a clear visible &lt;label&gt; for every field

Use the for attribute to associate the label with the input.

### Correct example:

```html
<label for="email">Email address</label><input id="email" type="email">
```

2. Do not rely on placeholder text

Placeholders are not labels because they disappear when the user types.

3. Avoid using title as a label

The title attribute provides a tooltip, not a reliable or accessible label.

4. Use aria-describedby for supplementary information only

Use it for hints or error messages, not as a replacement for labels.

5. Check custom and dynamic form components

Ensure design systems and generated UI elements keep visible labels intact.

## Best practice guidance

Labels should be short, descriptive and placed consistently so users can scan and complete forms efficiently. Avoid minimalist design patterns that remove labels in favour of placeholders. For multilingual sites, make sure labels remain visible and correctly translated. Test with assistive technologies to confirm labels are announced correctly.

## Compliance mapping

Providing visible labels supports: - WCAG 2.2 Labels and Instructions, - WCAG 2.2 Name, Role, Value requirements, - ADA Title III expectations for usable, understandable forms, - EN 301 549 requirements for programmatically determinable labels, - Equality Act 2010 duties for inclusive design.

## How Welcoming Web supports teams

Welcoming Web identifies form fields missing visible labels or using only hidden or metadata-based naming. The platform provides guidance for restoring visible labelling and improving form clarity.

## Key points for development teams

Visible labels are required for all fields. Placeholders cannot replace labels. title is not a valid primary label. Use aria-describedby only for supplementary text. Check design systems for label consistency.
