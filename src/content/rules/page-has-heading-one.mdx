# Page Has Heading One

<Callout type="info">
Page should contain a level-one heading
</Callout>

A page must contain a clear and meaningful level-one heading so users and assistive technologies can understand the main topic of the content. This blog explains what the page-has-heading-one rule checks, why an &lt;h1&gt; is essential for structure and navigation, how to implement it correctly and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider accessibility expectations. The article is fully original, accurate and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The page-has-heading-one rule checks whether a page, or at least one of its frames, contains a single &lt;h1&gt; element. The &lt;h1&gt; represents the primary heading for the content. It forms a key part of the document’s semantic structure.

Headings help assistive technologies interpret hierarchy and allow users to navigate content quickly.

## Why it matters

When a page does not contain a level-one heading: - screen reader users may struggle to understand the main topic of the page, - navigation through headings becomes less predictable, - users with cognitive impairments may find it harder to grasp structure, - search engines may interpret content inconsistently, - page templates may appear fragmented or incomplete.

An &lt;h1&gt; sets the context and anchors the page hierarchy.

## Who delivers it

Designers define heading patterns and ensure a clear hierarchy. Content authors write descriptive headings that summarise page purpose. Front end developers implement semantic heading levels in templates and components. Accessibility specialists and QA testers validate that each page includes one primary heading. Welcoming Web assists by detecting pages missing an &lt;h1&gt;.

How to ensure a page contains a level-one heading

1. Include exactly one &lt;h1&gt; element

Each page or frame should contain one primary heading.

```html
<h1>Account overview</h1>
```

2. Use &lt;h1&gt; for the main topic only

Do not use &lt;h1&gt; repeatedly across different sections.

3. Keep headings descriptive and relevant

The &lt;h1&gt; should summarise the page purpose clearly.

4. Ensure templates include consistent heading structure

CMS templates and page builders must generate an &lt;h1&gt; automatically or require one.

5. Avoid skipping directly to deeper heading levels

Maintain a logical sequence from &lt;h1&gt; downward.

## Best practice guidance

Use meaningful headings that describe content rather than decorative or generic phrases. Align &lt;h1&gt; text with page titles where possible. Avoid placing logos or non-content items inside headings. Confirm that iframes containing standalone documents also include a primary heading.

## Compliance mapping

Providing a level-one heading supports: - WCAG 2.2 Info and Relationships success criterion, - WCAG 2.2 Meaningful Sequence requirements, - ADA Title III expectations for understandable content, - EN 301 549 guidance on structural navigation, - Equality Act 2010 duties for clear and accessible communication.
