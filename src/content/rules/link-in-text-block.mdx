# Link In Text Block

<Callout type="info">
Links must be distinguishable without relying on colour
</Callout>

Links must be identifiable through more than colour alone so all users can recognise interactive text. This blog explains what the link-in-text-block rule checks, why colour‑only indicators fail accessibility, how to make links clearly distinguishable and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, accurate and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The link-in-text-block rule checks whether links inside paragraphs of text are distinguishable from surrounding content using more than colour. Relying solely on colour differences creates barriers for users with low vision, colour‑vision deficiencies or limited contrast perception.

Links should use at least one additional visual cue, such as underlines, bold styling, patterns or other non‑colour indicators.

## Why it matters

When links rely only on colour to communicate interactivity: - users with colour‑vision impairments struggle to identify them, - readers with low vision may miss links entirely, - links become harder to find in dense text blocks, - some colour combinations fail to reach required contrast levels, - users may not know where interactive elements appear.

Providing clear, non‑colour styling supports predictable navigation and improves the discoverability of interactive elements.

## Who delivers it

Designers define link styling patterns that use more than colour. Front end developers implement consistent styling across paragraphs, articles and rich‑text components. Content authors maintain clear link placement within text. Accessibility specialists and QA testers validate that links remain distinguishable under different contrast conditions. Welcoming Web assists by detecting links that rely on colour alone.

How to ensure links are distinguishable without relying on colour

1. Add an underline to inline links

Underlining is the strongest, most recognisable non‑colour cue.

### Example:

```html
a { text-decoration: underline; }
```
2. Use additional styling if underlining cannot be used

Bold weight, distinctive font treatment or patterns can complement link styling.

3. Avoid colour‑only distinctions

Do not present links in a different colour without any secondary cue.

4. Maintain consistent link styling across components

Users expect links to look the same in articles, lists, tables and blocks of text.

5. Ensure visited and active states are also distinguishable

Use visual cues beyond colour saturation or hue adjustments.

6. Validate on low‑contrast and grayscale displays

Links must remain recognisable even when colour perception is reduced.

## Best practice guidance

Use underlined links as the default, especially within paragraphs. Apply accessible hover and focus states that further reinforce interactivity. Avoid removing underlines unless replaced with equally strong cues. Document link styling patterns in your design system to ensure consistency across teams.

## Compliance mapping

Ensuring non‑colour link identification supports: - WCAG 2.2 Use of Colour success criterion, - WCAG 2.2 Contrast and Non‑Text Contrast expectations, - ADA Title III requirements for perceivable interactive elements, - EN 301 549 guidance on distinguishable controls, - Equality Act 2010 duties for accessible communication.

## FAQs

What does the link-in-text-block rule check

It checks whether inline links are distinguishable without relying on colour alone.

Why must links use more than colour

Links must use more than colour so all users, including those with colour‑vision impairments, can identify them.

What are acceptable cues

Underlines, bold styling, icon indicators or patterns are acceptable cues.

Do visited links need special styling

Yes. They should remain distinguishable without relying only on colour changes.

Can hover effects fix colour‑only issues

No. Links must be identifiable without requiring user action.

Do headings and menus follow the same rule

This rule specifically applies to text blocks, but consistent cues are recommended site‑wide.

Does adding underlines guarantee WCAG compliance

It supports use‑of‑colour requirements but does not guarantee full compliance.

How does Welcoming Web help with link visibility

Welcoming Web identifies colour‑only link styling and recommends accessible alternatives.
