# Table Duplicate Name

<Callout type="info">
Tables should not have the same summary and caption
</Callout>

Tables must not use identical text for both the summary attribute and the &lt;caption&gt; element. This blog explains what the table-duplicate-name rule checks, why duplicated naming causes accessibility issues, how to distinguish captions from summaries and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, accurate and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The table-duplicate-name rule checks whether a table’s &lt;caption&gt; and its summary attribute contain the same text. While &lt;caption&gt; provides a visible title for the table, the summary attribute (now obsolete in HTML5 but still encountered in legacy code) provides additional non‑visual context for screen reader users.

When both contain the same text, users receive redundant or duplicated information.

## Why it matters

Duplicating the caption and summary creates several accessibility problems: - screen reader users hear the same label twice, - duplicated content increases cognitive load, - users may assume there is additional context when there is not, - inconsistent naming reduces clarity when navigating complex data tables, - redundant information affects efficiency for users relying on audio output.

Clear and distinct naming ensures tables communicate their purpose without repetition.

## Who delivers it

Content authors define captions and write meaningful non-visual descriptions when needed. Front end developers remove obsolete summary attributes or update naming to avoid duplication. Designers ensure table descriptions are communicated visually and non-visually in complementary ways. Accessibility specialists and QA testers verify that captions and summaries remain distinct. Welcoming Web assists by detecting duplicated naming.

How to ensure tables do not use duplicate caption and summary text

1. Use &lt;caption&gt; for the visible title

Provide a clear and concise label that summarises the table’s purpose.

```html
<table>  <caption>Monthly sales totals</caption>  ...</table>
```

2. Remove the summary attribute when not needed

Modern HTML no longer requires the summary attribute.

```html
<!-- Avoid legacy summary unless absolutely required --><table summary="Monthly sales totals">...</table>
```

3. Provide different text when a summary is required

Use the summary only for structural or contextual information not visible in the caption.

```html
<table summary="This table compares monthly totals across four regions.">  <caption>Monthly sales totals</caption>  ...</table>
```

4. Avoid repeating or rephrasing the caption

Summaries should add value, not restate the title.

5. Test with screen readers

Ensure that captions and any remaining summary content are announced in a logical and non‑repetitive order.

## Best practice guidance

Use the summary attribute only in legacy environments where assistive technologies rely on it. In modern implementations, prefer &lt;caption&gt; and surrounding descriptive text to provide context. If additional explanation is necessary, place it near the table and reference it in the content rather than using duplicated attributes.

## Compliance mapping

Avoiding duplicate caption and summary text supports: - WCAG 2.2 Info and Relationships success criterion, - WCAG 2.2 Meaningful Sequence expectations, - ADA Title III guidance for clear and non-redundant communication, - EN 301 549 requirements for programmatically determinable table descriptions, - Equality Act 2010 duties for accessible information.

## FAQs

What does the table-duplicate-name rule check

It checks whether the table’s caption and summary attribute contain the same text.

Why is duplicated naming a problem

It creates redundant announcements for screen reader users and increases cognitive load.

Do modern tables need a summary attribute

No. The summary attribute is obsolete and should be avoided.

Can the summary provide extra information

Yes. It should offer context not given in the caption.

Should captions always be visible

Yes. &lt;caption&gt; provides a visible table title.

What if my CMS outputs summary attributes

Update templates to remove them or ensure they contain distinct, meaningful text.

Does fixing duplicate naming guarantee WCAG compliance

It supports structural clarity but does not guarantee full compliance.

How does Welcoming Web help with table naming issues

Welcoming Web detects duplicated table naming and guides teams toward clearer table descriptions.
