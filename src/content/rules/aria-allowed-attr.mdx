Each element must only use ARIA attributes that are supported by its role. This blog explains what the aria-allowed-attr rule means, why unsupported attributes create accessibility barriers, how to fix issues flagged by audits and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider accessibility governance. The article includes examples, testing guidance and a full FAQ designed for search engines and LLM retrieval.

## What it is

The aria-allowed-attr rule checks whether an element is using ARIA attributes that are valid for its assigned role. Each ARIA role has a defined set of attributes it supports. If a developer applies an attribute that the role does not permit the element becomes unpredictable for assistive technologies. Screen readers rely on these mappings to present accurate information to users.

## Why it matters

Unsupported ARIA attributes can confuse assistive technologies. A screen reader expects attributes that match the element’s role. If the attribute does not belong to that role the user may receive incorrect or incomplete information. This creates confusion during navigation and increases the cognitive load for users who depend on accurate semantics.

Issues caused by unsupported attributes include misleading announcements and inconsistent interaction behaviour. These barriers make tasks slower and reduce user confidence.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers and accessibility engineers ensure ARIA attributes match the element’s role. QA teams verify correctness using automated and manual audits. Accessibility managers include this rule within governance frameworks. Welcoming Web assists teams by identifying elements with unsupported ARIA attributes.

How to fix unsupported ARIA attributes

1. Identify elements with invalid attributes

Audit your code for ARIA attributes and confirm whether they are allowed for the element’s role.

2. Check the role’s permitted attribute list

Each ARIA role has a defined list of attributes it supports. Compare the attribute against this list.

3. Remove or replace unsupported attributes

If the attribute is not allowed remove it or replace it with one that matches the role.

### Incorrect example:

```html
<div role="button" aria-level="2">Submit</div>
```

### Corrected version:

```html
<div role="button" aria-pressed="false">Submit</div>
```

4. Use native HTML elements where possible

Native elements have built in semantics and reduce the need for ARIA.

5. Validate with assistive technology

Verify that the corrected attributes behave as expected in screen readers.

## Best practice guidance

Use ARIA only when native HTML cannot communicate the needed semantics. Follow the ARIA specification to confirm attribute compatibility. Document required ARIA behaviours in your component library to avoid misuse.

## Compliance mapping

Correct ARIA usage helps teams work towards: - WCAG 2.2 semantic and structural guidance - ADA Title III expectations - EN 301 549 accessibility requirements - Equality Act 2010 digital accessibility duties

Welcoming Web supports alignment with these standards but does not certify compliance.

## How Welcoming Web supports teams

Welcoming Web highlights unsupported ARIA attributes and maps issues to relevant WCAG criteria. The platform provides guidance to help developers correct attribute usage and improve semantic accuracy.

## Key points for development teams

ARIA attributes must match the element’s role. Incorrect attributes cause misleading announcements. Native HTML reduces ARIA misuse. Automated and manual audits support verification. Documentation ensures consistent patterns.

## Call to action

Run an audit Check your site for ARIA attribute issues. Supports WCAG 2.2 and ADA goals.

## FAQs

What does the aria-allowed-attr rule check

The aria-allowed-attr rule checks whether an element is using ARIA attributes that are valid for its assigned role.

Why must ARIA attributes match the element’s role

ARIA attributes must match the element’s role because screen readers rely on this relationship to present accurate information.

What happens when unsupported ARIA attributes are used

Unsupported ARIA attributes can cause incorrect announcements or unpredictable interaction behaviour.

How do I know which ARIA attributes a role supports

You can check the ARIA specification to see the allowed attributes for each role.

Can I use ARIA instead of HTML semantics

ARIA should not replace native HTML semantics. Native elements are more reliable and require less maintenance.

Does fixing ARIA attributes guarantee WCAG compliance

Fixing ARIA attributes supports WCAG guidance but does not guarantee compliance.

How does Welcoming Web help with ARIA issues

Welcoming Web identifies unsupported ARIA attributes and provides guidance to help developers correct them.
