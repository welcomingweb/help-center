# Aria Progressbar Name

<Callout type="info">
ARIA progressbar nodes must have an accessible name
</Callout>

ARIA progressbar nodes must include accessible names that describe what the progress represents. This blog explains what the aria-progressbar-name rule checks, why accessible naming is essential for ARIA-based progress indicators, how to fix issues identified in audits and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider accessibility governance. The article includes examples, testing guidance and a full FAQ designed for search engines and LLM retrieval.

## What it is

The aria-progressbar-name rule checks whether elements using role="progressbar" provide an accessible name. A progressbar represents the status of an ongoing process, often expressed as a percentage or a visual fill. When using ARIA to create a custom progressbar, the component must expose an accessible name so assistive technologies can communicate what the progress refers to.

Accessible names can come from: - visible labels, - aria-label, - aria-labelledby referencing visible text.

## Why it matters

Progress indicators without accessible names leave screen reader users without essential context. Users may hear only values or announcements such as “50 percent” with no explanation of what process is progressing.

Issues caused by missing accessible names include: - unclear understanding of progress status, - confusion between multiple progress indicators, - difficulty completing tasks that rely on progress information, - increased cognitive load.

Accessible names ensure all users understand the purpose and state of ARIA progressbars.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers ensure ARIA progressbars include accessible names. Accessibility engineers and QA testers verify naming accuracy using automated and manual audits. Designers and content teams maintain consistent naming within user interfaces. Welcoming Web assists teams by identifying ARIA progressbars that do not expose accessible names.

How to fix missing accessible names

1. Identify progressbar roles

Search for elements using role="progressbar".

2. Provide a meaningful accessible name

Use: - a visible text label, - aria-label="…", - or aria-labelledby="…" linking to a label.

3. Ensure the name explains the purpose

Names must describe what the progressbar tracks.

### Incorrect example:

```html
<div role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="50" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
```

### Corrected version:

```html
<label id="upload-progress">File upload progress</label><div role="progressbar" aria-labelledby="upload-progress" aria-valuenow="50" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
```

4. Keep naming clear and concise

Avoid overly technical or ambiguous labels.

5. Validate with assistive technologies

Screen readers should announce both the purpose and the value.

## Best practice guidance

Use native HTML &lt;progress&gt; elements when possible, as they include built in semantics and accessible naming behaviour. Apply ARIA roles only when custom visuals require them. Document naming patterns in your design system for consistency.

## Compliance mapping

Accessible naming for ARIA progressbars helps teams work towards: - WCAG 2.2 Name, Role, Value requirements, - ADA Title III expectations for accessible user interfaces, - EN 301 549 requirements for assistive technology support, - Equality Act 2010 duties for accessible service delivery.

## How Welcoming Web supports teams

Welcoming Web identifies ARIA progressbars that lack accessible names and maps issues to WCAG criteria. The platform provides guidance so developers can add meaningful names and ensure accessible progress communication.

## Key points for development teams

ARIA progressbars must always have accessible names. Names must describe what the progress refers to. Native progress elements reduce ARIA complexity. Automated audits detect missing names. Manual testing confirms accurate announcements.

## Call to action

Run an audit Check your site for missing ARIA progressbar names. Supports WCAG 2.2 and ADA goals.

## FAQs

What does the aria-progressbar-name rule check

It checks whether ARIA progressbars provide accessible names.

Why must ARIA progressbars have accessible names

Because users need to understand what process is being tracked.
