# Empty Table Header

<Callout type="info">
Table header text should not be empty
</Callout>

Table headers must contain discernible text so users can understand the structure and meaning of tabular data. This blog explains what the empty-table-header rule checks, why empty headers cause accessibility barriers, how to provide clear header text and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, SEO-optimised and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The empty-table-header rule checks whether table header cells, typically marked up with &lt;th&gt;, contain meaningful, readable text. Header cells describe the rows or columns they relate to. When a header is empty or contains only decorative content, assistive technologies cannot convey how data in the table is organised.

Empty header cells can appear when: - authors use &lt;th&gt; purely for visual styling, - placeholder text is removed but headers remain, - icons or background images are used instead of text, - column or row labels are omitted.

## Why it matters

Tables rely on headers to explain what each row and column represents. When headers are empty: - screen reader users hear blank or unnamed headers, - users may not know what a particular value means, - navigating across cells becomes confusing, - cognitive load increases because relationships are unclear.

Clear header text supports reliable navigation, improves comprehension and helps users compare data accurately.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers and content authors are responsible for providing meaningful header text. Designers specify how table headers should appear while maintaining clarity. Accessibility engineers and QA testers verify that header cells contain discernible text and that tables follow a logical structure. Welcoming Web assists by detecting empty table headers and mapping them to WCAG requirements.

How to fix empty table headers

1. Add descriptive text to each &lt;th&gt; cell

Every header must describe the data in its row or column.

### Incorrect example:

```html
<table>  <tr>    <th></th>    <th></th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>10</td>    <td>20</td>  </tr></table>
```

### Corrected version:

```html
<table>  <tr>    <th>January sales</th>    <th>February sales</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>10</td>    <td>20</td>  </tr></table>
```

2. Replace icon-only headers with text

Icons may support meaning but must not replace clear text labels.

3. Avoid using &lt;th&gt; for layout or styling

Use CSS classes on &lt;td&gt; or other elements instead of empty headers.

4. Check dynamic tables

Ensure that columns generated by scripts receive appropriate header text.

5. Validate with assistive technologies

Test tables using screen readers to confirm that headers are announced correctly.

## Best practice guidance

Design tables with a clear purpose and minimal complexity. Use concise but descriptive header text. Avoid splitting related information across multiple ambiguous headers. When tables are large, consider grouping headers or using scope attributes to reinforce relationships. Provide captions or summaries when tables convey complex data.

## Compliance mapping

Ensuring table headers have discernible text supports: - WCAG 2.2 requirements for info and relationships, - ADA Title III expectations for understandable data presentation, - EN 301 549 guidance on programmatically determinable structure, - Equality Act 2010 duties for accessible information.

## How Welcoming Web supports teams

Welcoming Web identifies empty or unclear table headers and highlights tables where structural labels are missing. The platform provides guidance so teams can correct markup, improve data clarity and support accessible navigation.

## Key points for development teams

Table headers must contain clear text. Empty &lt;th&gt; cells create confusion. Icons cannot replace header labels. Dynamic tables need generated header text. Testing with assistive tech confirms structure.

## Call to action

Run an audit Check your site for empty table headers. Supports WCAG 2.2 and ADA goals.

## FAQs

What does the empty-table-header rule check

It checks whether table header cells contain meaningful, discernible text.

Why are empty table headers a problem

Because they hide the structure of the table from screen readers and other users.

Can I use icons instead of text in headers

No. Icons must be supported by clear text labels.

How do I fix empty headers

Add descriptive text to each &lt;th&gt; or remove unnecessary headers.

Is it acceptable to use &lt;th&gt; only for styling

No. Use &lt;th&gt; only when the cell acts as a header.

Do dynamically generated tables need headers

Yes. All tables should expose clear headers where data relationships need explanation.

How does Welcoming Web help with table header issues

Welcoming Web detects empty table headers and provides guidance to correct them.
