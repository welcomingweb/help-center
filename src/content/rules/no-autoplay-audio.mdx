# No Autoplay Audio

<Callout type="info">
or  elements must not play automatically
</Callout>

Audio and video must not autoplay for more than three seconds without a clear way to pause, stop or mute the sound. This blog explains what the no-autoplay-audio rule checks, why autoplaying media causes accessibility issues, how to ensure compliant behaviour and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider accessibility expectations. The article is fully original, accurate and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The no-autoplay-audio rule checks whether &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; elements play audio automatically for more than three seconds without giving users control. Autoplaying sound can interfere with assistive technologies and disrupt concentration.

Autoplay may occur when developers use: - &lt;audio autoplay&gt; - &lt;video autoplay&gt; - media libraries or scripts that trigger playback on load

The rule requires that users must be able to pause, stop or mute the audio.

## Why it matters

Autoplaying audio creates barriers for many users: - screen reader output may be drowned out by unexpected sound - users with cognitive impairments may be startled or distracted - people in quiet environments may struggle to continue using the page - users with attention-related conditions may find it difficult to regain focus - autoplay can cause immediate usability issues on mobile and low-bandwidth devices

Providing user control ensures predictable and comfortable interaction.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers configure media elements correctly. Designers avoid patterns that rely on autoplay to draw attention. Content authors provide clear captions, transcripts and alternative formats. Accessibility specialists and QA testers verify that no autoplaying audio persists beyond three seconds without controls. Welcoming Web assists by detecting media elements that violate autoplay requirements.

How to prevent autoplaying audio issues

1. Remove the autoplay attribute

Do not autoplay audio or video with sound.

```html
<!-- Remove autoplay --><video src="intro.mp4" controls></video>
```

2. Provide clear user controls

Ensure users can pause, stop or mute the audio easily. Use built‑in media controls or custom accessible components.

3. Use muted autoplay only when essential

If visual autoplay is needed, set muted to ensure no audio plays.

```html
<video autoplay muted loop></video>
```

4. Allow users to enable sound

Use buttons or interactions that explicitly request permission before playing audio.

5. Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

Verify that controls are visible, operable and announced correctly.

## Best practice guidance

Avoid autoplaying audio entirely. Provide captions, transcripts and descriptions for all media. Ensure controls are visible, labelled and reachable by keyboard. For complex media components, follow WAI‑ARIA Authoring Practices for video players.

## Compliance mapping

Preventing autoplaying audio supports: - WCAG 2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide success criterion - WCAG 2.2 Predictable interaction expectations - ADA Title III expectations for user‑controlled media - EN 301 549 guidance on operable multimedia controls - Equality Act 2010 duties for inclusive information access

Welcoming Web supports alignment with recognised standards but does not issue or guarantee compliance certification.

## How Welcoming Web supports teams

Welcoming Web identifies autoplaying media and highlights elements that lack the required controls. The platform provides guidance for fixing player behaviour and improving user experience.

## Key points for development teams

Do not autoplay media with sound. Provide pause, stop or mute controls. Use muted autoplay for visuals only. Ensure controls are accessible. Test with assistive technologies.

## Call to action
