# Meta Refresh

<Callout type="info">
Delayed refresh under 20 hours must not be used
</Callout>

A delayed meta refresh must not be used for page updates or timed navigation because it disrupts user control and creates accessibility barriers. This blog explains what the meta-refresh rule checks, why timing-based refreshes are problematic, how to replace them with accessible alternatives and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, accurate and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The meta-refresh rule checks whether a document uses a &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh"&gt; element to automatically refresh or redirect the page after a delay of less than 20 hours. This pattern forces time-based navigation without user consent.

Meta refresh may be used for: - timed redirects, - forced reloads, - countdown-driven navigation changes.

These approaches are discouraged because they remove user control and create unpredictable behaviour.

## Why it matters

When pages refresh automatically: - users may lose their reading position or form progress, - screen reader users can be disoriented when content reloads unexpectedly, - people with cognitive impairments may struggle with sudden context changes, - timed navigation interrupts tasks and reduces usability, - assistive technologies may not announce the refresh in a predictable way.

Uncontrolled timing behaviour creates barriers for many users.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers remove meta refresh patterns and replace them with user-controlled alternatives. Designers avoid UX patterns that depend on automatic redirects. Content authors ensure timing-based behaviours are not introduced in templates. Accessibility specialists and QA testers validate that no meta refresh elements appear in code. Welcoming Web assists by detecting the presence of &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh"&gt; with problematic timing values.

How to ensure meta refresh is not used for delayed refresh

1. Remove &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh"&gt; elements

Do not rely on automatic timing-based page updates.

```html
<!-- Remove this --><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;url=/new-page">
```

2. Provide user-controlled actions

Use visible buttons or clear UI controls for navigation or content reload.

3. Use JavaScript for optional, non-forced updates

Content updates should be user-triggered and predictable.

4. Implement accessible live regions for essential announcements

Use ARIA live regions for dynamic updates without refreshing the entire page.

5. Use server-side redirects for immediate navigation

If a redirect is required, perform it instantly rather than using a timed refresh.

## Best practice guidance

Maintain clear and stable interfaces without forced timing. Avoid any pattern that removes user agency or disrupts reading flow. When timed behaviour is essential for security or inactivity, provide warnings, countdowns and clear controls.

## Compliance mapping

Removing timed refreshes under 20 hours supports: - WCAG 2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide success criteria, - WCAG 2.2 Predictable operation requirements, - ADA Title III expectations for user-controlled interaction, - EN 301 549 guidance on avoiding unexpected timing behaviour, - Equality Act 2010 duties for inclusive and stable content.

## FAQs

What does the meta-refresh rule check

It checks whether &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh"&gt; is used to refresh or redirect a page after a delay of less than 20 hours.

Why must delayed meta refresh not be used

It must not be used because it forces timed navigation and removes user control.

Can immediate redirects use meta refresh

Immediate redirects are less problematic but should be replaced with server-side redirects.

What should replace meta refresh

Use user-controlled navigation or server-side redirection.

Does JavaScript fix meta refresh issues

JavaScript can provide accessible alternatives when updates are user-triggered.

Are timed updates ever allowed

Only when they provide clear warnings and full user control.

Does removing meta refresh guarantee WCAG compliance

It supports timing and predictability requirements but does not guarantee full compliance.

How does Welcoming Web help with meta refresh issues

Welcoming Web detects timed refreshes and recommends accessible alternatives.
