# Aria Hidden Focus

<Callout type="info">
ARIA hidden element must not be focusable or contain focusable elements
</Callout>

ARIA hidden elements must not receive focus and must not contain child elements that can be focused. This blog explains what the aria-hidden-focus rule checks, why focusable elements inside aria-hidden regions create accessibility barriers, how to fix issues highlighted during audits and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider accessibility governance. The article includes examples, testing guidance and a full FAQ designed for search engines and LLM retrieval.

## What it is

The aria-hidden-focus rule checks whether an element with aria-hidden="true" is itself focusable or contains elements that users can focus with the keyboard. When aria-hidden is applied, the element is treated as invisible to assistive technologies. Focusable elements must always remain available to screen reader users. If a hidden element becomes focusable, it traps focus in an inaccessible region.

Focusable elements include: - links (&lt;a href&gt;), - buttons, - inputs and form fields, - elements with tabindex="0" or positive tabindex values.

## Why it matters

When an aria-hidden element can receive focus, screen reader users experience severe accessibility barriers. They may: - move focus to content that is hidden, - become stuck inside an inaccessible region, - lose track of their current position, - activate controls that are visually removed or inactive.

This leads to confusion and breaks the expected navigation flow. aria-hidden must only be applied to non-interactive, non-focusable content.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers ensure that aria-hidden is used only on non-focusable content. Accessibility engineers and QA testers identify any violations through automated and manual audits. Design system teams document safe use of aria-hidden. Welcoming Web assists teams by detecting focusable content inside aria-hidden regions.

How to fix aria-hidden focus issues

1. Identify aria-hidden elements

Search the codebase for any use of aria-hidden="true".

2. Check if the element or its children are focusable

Look for: - interactive elements, - tabindex attributes, - scripts injecting focusable nodes.

3. Remove or relocate focusable content

Focusable elements must not remain inside aria-hidden regions.

### Incorrect example:

```html
<div aria-hidden="true">  <button>Submit</button></div>
```

### Corrected version:

```html
<div aria-hidden="true"></div><button>Submit</button>
```

4. Avoid hiding interactive components

If the component must remain interactive, do not use aria-hidden. Use CSS techniques instead.

5. Validate with keyboard and screen reader testing

Ensure users cannot tab into hidden content and that assistive technologies announce all interactive controls.

## Best practice guidance

Use aria-hidden carefully and only for decorative or redundant elements. Avoid using it on containers that may later receive interactive child elements. Keep your component library updated with safe aria-hidden patterns.

## Compliance mapping

Correct use of aria-hidden supports teams as they work towards: - WCAG 2.2 focus order and keyboard guidance, - ADA Title III expectations for accessible user interactions, - EN 301 549 requirements for assistive technology support, - Equality Act 2010 obligations for accessible services.

Welcoming Web supports alignment with recognised standards but does not certify compliance.

## How Welcoming Web supports teams

Welcoming Web flags aria-hidden regions that contain focusable elements. The platform maps these findings to WCAG criteria and provides guidance to help developers remove hidden focus traps.

## Key points for development teams

aria-hidden regions must never be focusable. Focusable content must not appear inside aria-hidden containers. Keyboard and screen reader users must never encounter hidden controls. Automated audits identify common violations. Manual testing confirms correct focus behaviour.

## Call to action

Run an audit Check your site for hidden focus traps. Supports WCAG 2.2 and ADA goals.

## FAQs

What does the aria-hidden-focus rule check

It checks whether an aria-hidden element is focusable or contains focusable child elements.

Why must aria-hidden elements not be focusable

Because focusable content must remain available to assistive technologies and cannot be hidden.

Does aria-hidden remove elements from the accessibility tree

Yes, and focusable elements must not exist inside hidden regions.

Can aria-hidden be used on interactive components

No. aria-hidden must only be applied to non-interactive content.

What happens if a script adds focusable elements inside aria-hidden content

The script must be updated to prevent hidden focusable nodes.

Does fixing aria-hidden focus issues guarantee WCAG compliance

It supports WCAG requirements but does not guarantee compliance.

How does Welcoming Web help with aria-hidden issues

Welcoming Web identifies when aria-hidden regions contain focusable content and provides guidance to help developers resolve the issue.
