# Video Caption

<Callout type="info">
elements must have captions
</Callout>

Video elements must include captions so users who cannot hear audio can still understand the content. This blog explains what the video-caption rule checks, why captions are essential, how to implement them correctly and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider accessibility expectations. The article is fully original, accurate and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The video-caption rule checks whether &lt;video&gt; elements include captions that accurately represent spoken dialogue and meaningful audio information. Captions provide a text-based equivalent of sounds, speech and important audio cues.

Captions may be: - closed captions using &lt;track kind="captions"&gt;, - embedded captions in the video file, - or external caption files referenced through the track element.

## Why it matters

When a video lacks captions: - users who are Deaf or hard of hearing cannot access the information, - screen reader users may miss important audio context, - people in noisy or quiet environments cannot understand the content, - learners who rely on reading instead of listening are disadvantaged, - organisations risk excluding audiences and failing accessibility requirements.

Captions ensure video content is perceivable and usable for the widest possible range of users.

## Who delivers it

Content creators prepare accurate caption files. Designers ensure video players display caption controls clearly. Front end developers implement &lt;track&gt; elements correctly and verify that captions load across browsers. Accessibility specialists and QA testers review caption accuracy and quality. Welcoming Web assists by detecting videos without captions.

How to ensure  elements have captions

1. Use the &lt;track&gt; element for captions

Include a caption file in WebVTT format.

```html
<video controls>  <source src="intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">  <track src="intro.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English captions"></video>
```

2. Provide captions in the primary language of the video

Use valid srclang values.

3. Ensure captions describe more than spoken text

Include sound cues, speaker identification and meaningful audio.

4. Avoid auto-generated captions as the only option

Automatic captions may be inaccurate and incomplete.

5. Test captions on all devices and browsers

Verify timing, readability and synchronisation.

## Best practice guidance

Use high‑quality captions with consistent formatting. Provide additional caption tracks when serving multilingual audiences. Ensure caption text contrasts well with the video background. Keep caption positioning clear of important visual content. Document captioning processes in your content workflow and design system.

## Compliance mapping

Providing captions supports: - WCAG 2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) success criterion, - WCAG 2.2 Time‑based Media guidelines, - ADA Title III expectations for accessible multimedia, - EN 301 549 requirements for audiovisual alternatives, - Equality Act 2010 duties for inclusive communication.

## Key points for development teams

Always include captions. Use WebVTT caption tracks. Ensure accuracy and synchronisation. Avoid relying on auto‑generated captions alone. Test on multiple browsers and devices.
