# Empty Heading

<Callout type="info">
Headings should not be empty
</Callout>

Headings must contain discernible text so users can understand the structure and purpose of each section. This blog explains what the empty-heading rule checks, why empty headings create barriers for navigation, how to ensure headings include meaningful content and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, SEO-optimised and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The empty-heading rule checks whether heading elements such as &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; contain visible, descriptive text. A heading exists to label a section and convey structure. When headings are empty—or contain only decorative icons—assistive technologies cannot determine the purpose of the heading or the content that follows.

Empty headings may appear due to: - placeholder markup not filled with text, - headings used solely for styling, - headings that rely on background images or icons instead of text, - content removed dynamically without updating the heading.

## Why it matters

Headings help users understand the hierarchy of information. When headings do not include meaningful text: - screen reader users encounter confusing or silent navigation points, - keyboard users cannot rely on heading shortcuts to move through content, - cognitive effort increases as page structure becomes unclear, - users may miss important sections because headings offer no context.

Meaningful headings improve readability, support predictable navigation and provide essential context for assistive technologies.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers ensure heading elements include real text. Designers create clear, descriptive section titles. Content teams maintain concise and consistent headings. Accessibility engineers and QA testers validate that headings are present, meaningful and in the correct order. Welcoming Web assists by detecting empty headings and mapping them to WCAG requirements.

How to fix empty headings

1. Provide descriptive text for every heading

Each heading must contain meaningful content.

### Incorrect example:

```html
<h2></h2>
```

### Corrected version:

```html
<h2>Product details</h2>
```

2. Avoid using headings solely for visual styling

Use CSS classes for styling instead of adding empty heading markup.

3. Replace icon-only headings with text

Icons may support meaning but cannot replace accessible text.

4. Review dynamically generated content

Ensure headings update correctly when UI sections load or change.

5. Maintain a clear hierarchy

Ensure headings follow a logical outline so assistive technologies can interpret structure.

## Best practice guidance

Headings should be concise, descriptive and relevant to the content below them. Avoid redundant headings such as “Section” or “Information”. Use headings to create a predictable structure that users can navigate quickly. Regularly review page templates to ensure all headings include meaningful text.

## Compliance mapping

Ensuring headings contain discernible text supports: - WCAG 2.2 requirements for labels, structure and meaningful sequence, - ADA Title III expectations for clear navigation cues, - EN 301 549 requirements for programmatically determinable content, - Equality Act 2010 duties for understandable digital information.
