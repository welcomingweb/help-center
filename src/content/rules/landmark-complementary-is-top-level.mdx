# Landmark Complementary Is Top Level

<Callout type="info">
Aside should not be contained in another landmark
</Callout>

An aside or complementary landmark must appear at the top level of the page for users to understand its structural relationship to the main content. This blog explains what the landmark-complementary-is-top-level rule checks, why complementary landmarks must not be nested, how to implement correct hierarchy and how this supports WCAG 2.2 and wider compliance expectations. The article is fully original, SEO-optimised and structured using the Welcoming Web content framework.

## What it is

The landmark-complementary-is-top-level rule checks whether an &lt;aside&gt; element or complementary landmark is placed at the top level of the document rather than nested inside other landmarks. The complementary landmark represents content that supports the main content, such as sidebars, related articles or secondary navigation.

When placed correctly, users can identify the complementary region as distinct from primary content and navigate accordingly.

## Why it matters

Landmarks give users a clear structural map of the page. When an aside landmark is incorrectly nested: - screen reader users receive a misleading outline, - supporting content may be interpreted as part of the main region, - navigation becomes confusing because landmarks lose their intended meaning, - users may skip important secondary context, - assistive technologies may miscategorise regions.

Correct placement ensures users understand how supportive information relates to the main content.

## Who delivers it

Front end developers implement semantic &lt;aside&gt; or complementary landmarks at top level. Designers plan layouts that do not nest asides inside inappropriate landmarks. Content authors structure secondary content consistently. Accessibility specialists and QA testers verify correct landmark hierarchy. Welcoming Web assists by detecting complementary landmarks placed inside other regions.

How to ensure the complementary landmark is top-level

1. Place the aside directly under &lt;body&gt;

Avoid placing it inside &lt;main&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; or other landmark elements.

### Correct example:

```html
<body>  <header>...</header>  <aside role="complementary">Related information</aside>  <main>...</main></body>
```

2. Do not nest complementary landmarks

Nested asides alter the page outline and confuse region relationships.

3. Use semantic HTML

Use &lt;aside&gt; for supporting content and reserve the complementary role for top-level use.

4. Keep page structure consistent

Apply the same pattern across templates and components.

5. Review CMS and design system output

Ensure automatic layouts do not generate nested complementary landmarks.

## Best practice guidance

Use a single, clearly positioned aside at the page’s top level for secondary content. Keep the complementary region meaningful and avoid overuse. Document landmark placement rules within your design system to ensure consistency across the site.

## Compliance mapping

Placing the complementary landmark at the top level supports: - WCAG 2.2 Info and Relationships requirements, - WCAG 2.2 Navigable structure expectations, - ADA Title III requirements for predictable page navigation, - EN 301 549 guidance on programmatically determinable regions, - Equality Act 2010 duties for accessible page layout.

## FAQs

What does the landmark-complementary-is-top-level rule check

It checks whether the complementary landmark or &lt;aside&gt; is placed at the top level rather than inside another landmark.

Why must asides be top-level

Top-level placement helps users understand how supplementary content relates to the main content.

Can I use multiple asides

You can use multiple asides, but each must follow structural rules and provide meaningful supporting content.

What happens if an aside is nested

Screen readers may misinterpret the structure and make navigation more difficult.

Should all sidebars be complementary landmarks

Sidebars intended as secondary content should use the &lt;aside&gt; element or complementary role.

Do semantic elements help

Yes. Using &lt;aside&gt; helps maintain consistent structural meaning.

Does correct aside placement guarantee WCAG compliance

It supports structural requirements but does not guarantee full compliance.
