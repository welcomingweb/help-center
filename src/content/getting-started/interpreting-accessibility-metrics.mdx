# Interpreting Accessibility Metrics

Your dashboard provides clear, actionable metrics that help you gauge and improve your site’s accessibility. This guide walks you through each key metric and shows you how to prioritize your next steps.

<Callout type="info">
  Accessibility metrics range from 0–100, where higher scores indicate better compliance with accessibility standards.
</Callout>

## Key Metrics

### Accessibility Score  
A percentage that reflects overall compliance with accessibility best practices.  
- **0–49**: Significant barriers—critical improvements needed.  
- **50–89**: Moderate compliance—tackle high-impact issues first.  
- **90–100**: Strong compliance—fine-tune minor improvements.

### Critical Issues  
The count of highest-priority violations that severely impact users with disabilities. Address these immediately.

### Performance Score  
While focused on speed and responsiveness, performance also affects users relying on assistive technologies. A fast, lean site enhances the accessibility experience.
