## Understanding Your Metrics

- **Accessibility Scores:** Scores indicate how well your sites adhere to best accessibility practices. Aim for scores of 90% or higher.
- **Critical Issues:** Prioritize resolving critical issues first, as they significantly impact user accessibility.
- **Compliance Levels:** Helps you quickly identify compliance strengths and areas for improvement based on various standards.

Use your dashboard to monitor, analyze, and continuously improve your sites' accessibility.
