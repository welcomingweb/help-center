## Key Sections of Your Report

<Steps>

### Step 1: Audit Pages

This section lists all pages included in the scan. Click any page URL to access detailed audit findings specific to that page.

### Step 2: Scan Summary

- **Status:** Shows whether the scan was successful.
- **Last Scan:** Indicates the date and time of the last completed scan.
- **Pages Crawled:** Displays the total number of pages included.
- **Subdomains:** Lists any subdomains included in the scan.

### Step 3: Performance Scores

Accessibility and Performance scores provide quick insight into the health of your site:

- **Accessibility:** Measures how accessible your website is for users with disabilities.
- **Performance:** Assesses the overall load speed and responsiveness.

These scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better compliance and performance.

### Step 4: Screenshot Preview

Provides a visual snapshot of the website as it appeared at the time of the scan, helping to identify any immediate visual issues.

### Step 5: Detailed Audit Results

Expanding sections like **Accessibility** or **Performance** reveals detailed lists of issues found, including severity, description, and suggestions for remediation.

## Interpreting Accessibility Scores

- **Excellent (90-100):** Your site meets most accessibility standards.
- **Good (70-89):** Your site is generally accessible but could improve.
- **Needs Work (0-69):** Immediate attention needed; your site has critical accessibility issues.

Regularly monitoring and addressing these issues ensures your website remains accessible and compliant.
