## Step-by-Step Improvement

<Steps>
### 1. Tackle Critical Errors  
Fix blocking barriers first—missing labels, empty buttons, or hidden content.

### 2. Address High-Severity Issues  
Resolve major usability problems like form input labeling and ARIA roles.

### 3. Refine Medium & Low Issues  
Polish enhancements: focus styling, live region announcements, skip links.

### 4. Manual Verification  
Test with keyboard only and a screen reader to catch issues automated scans miss.

### 5. Re-scan & Track Progress  
Run another scan and compare scores to measure your improvement.
</Steps>

## Ongoing Best Practices

- **Consistent Headings**  
  Use a logical `<h1>`–`<h6>` hierarchy to organize content.

- **Readable Text**  
  Keep font sizes ≥ 16px and maintain sufficient line height.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Ensure layouts adapt across screen sizes and support zoom up to 200%.

- **Form Accessibility**  
  Label every form control clearly and position labels close to inputs.

- **Focus Indicators**  
  Make keyboard focus visible with clear outlines or custom styles.
